# Recipe-Suggestor
Spring 2018 project used to learn Python.

Recipe Suggestion Tool (Recipe Suggestor/RST) is meant to take the decision-making out of cooking! 

  Using ingredient tags, our Pug-Chef will suggest a random recipe using an ingredient or two of your choosing.

 	For a wider variety, add your own recipes using the submission form!

	RST was created by Jim Witt and Anna Bobcova between April 2018-June 2018, for the Python portion of Computation and Mindfulness taught by Richard Weiss, Spring 2018.
