# Recipe-Suggestor
Spring 2018 project used to learn Python.

Recipe Suggestion Tool (Recipe Suggestor/RST) is meant to take the decision-making out of cooking! 

Using ingredient tags, our Pug-Chef will suggest a random recipe using an ingredient or two of your choosing.

For a wider variety, add your own recipes using the submission form!

RST was created by Jim Witt and Anna Bobcova between April 2018-June 2018, for the Python portion of Computation and Mindfulness taught by Richard Weiss, Spring 2018.

Have ingredients on hand about to go bad? Bought a new veggie on a whim and don’t know what to do with it? Here’s our solution:
 
# How It Works:
Program prompts user to enter an ingredient that they have on hand.
After user enters an ingredient the program searches through a list of recipes to see if any of the recipes in the list contain the desired ingredient and a new list is generated containing all recipes that use the ingredient.
After that a recipe is randomly taken from the new list and suggested to the user including other ingredients for the recipe as well as the method for making the recipe.
